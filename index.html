 <p>hi, i'm hareesh nagarajan, a <i>senior</i> software engineer at
 google. i was born in 1982, the year of the dog. i joined google in
 2006, also the year of the dog. i work on gmail. before that i used
 to work on the google search appliance. in my <a
 href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google#Innovation_Time_Off">20%
 time</a> i've built many little tools to visualize people analytics,
 but i'm not going to talk about that here. in my free time i like to
 build inexpensive toys that change the world one small step at a
 time. </p>

 <p>i built <a href="http://pravaas.org">pravaas.org</a> where high
 quality mentor-ship and advice is made available to every student
 anywhere in this world for free</p>
 
 <p>while browsing through twitter i discovered that i could do a
 better job (using interesting spam filtering algorithms) of
 connecting people with cancer and people who know people with cancer
 on twitter than twitter itself so i built <a
 href="http://tweetandbeat.com">tweetandbeat.com</a></p>

 <p>while playing with the twitter API, i discovered a nifty way of
 marketing websites and services on twitter and so i built <a
 href="http://linkybinky.com">linkybinky.com</a>. i haven't released
 this to the public yet.</p>

 <p>i figured there has to be a more terse way of uploading images on
 twitter and so i built <a href="http://twimgr.com">twimgr.com</a>
 where you can embed your status update inside the URL of the image
 that you upload. yes it is very geeky.</p>

 <p>i built <a href="http://ps3btc.com">ps3 is better than cake</a> to
 help ps3 users on twitter meet others just like them. i also felt
 that my UI was a lot more intuitive than the one provided by
 twitter.</p>
 
 <p>i pontificate tersely at <a href="http://d0j.blogspot.com">thus
 spake hareesh nagarajan</a>. my observations are always <a
 href="http://d0j.blogspot.com/2009/09/why-does-tennis-have-fewer-unique.html">original</a>. my
 <a
 href="http://friendfeed.com/search?q=twitgoo.com+from:hareesh">photo
 blog</a> as seen from the camera of my nexus one. my <a
 href="http://twitter.com/hnag">twitter feed</a>. i think i've bored
 you <a
 href="http://www.google.com/#q=hareesh+nagarajan">enough</a></p>
 
 <p>if you've seen any of the links above you can tell that i lack web
 design skills. i've shamelessly copied the design of this website
 from <a href="http://naveenium.com/">naveenium.com</a></p>
