 <p>i'm hareesh nagarajan, a software engineer at <i>the</i> google. i
 believe in analyzing everything with data. i was born in 1982, the
 year of the dog. i joined google in 2006, also the year of the dog. i
 work on gmail. before that i used to work on the google search
 appliance. in my <a
 href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google#Innovation_Time_Off">20%
 time</a> i've built many little tools to visualize people analytics,
 but i'm not going to talk about them here. in my free time i like to
 build inexpensive little applications and services that change the
 world one small step at a time. </p>

 <p>i built <a href="http://www.pravaas.org">pravaas.org</a> to make
 high quality mentor-ship and advice available to every student
 anywhere in this world for free</p>
 
 <p>while browsing through twitter i discovered that i could do a
 better job (using interesting spam filtering algorithms) of
 connecting people with cancer and people who know people with cancer
 on twitter than twitter itself so i built <a
 href="http://www.tweetandbeat.com">tweetandbeat.com</a>.</p>

 <p>while playing with the twitter API, i discovered a nifty way to
 market websites and services and so i built <a
 href="http://www.linkybinky.com">linkybinky.com</a>. i haven't
 released this to the public yet. talk to me if you want to know
 more.</p>

 <p>i figured there has to be a more terse way of uploading images on
 twitter and so i built <a href="http://www.twimgr.com">twimgr.com</a>
 using which you can embed your status update inside the URL of the
 image that you upload.</p>

 <p>i built <a href="http://www.ps3btc.com">ps3 is better than
 cake</a> to help ps3 users meet other ps3 users. i think i got the UI
 correct on this one rare occassion.</p>

 <p>i built <a href="http://www.whoclicksmylinks.info">who clicks my
 links?</a> because i wondered if anyone at all clicks on the links
 that people tweet. it turns out people do, but the number is
 tiny. very, very tiny.</p>
 
 <p>i like to think that i pontificate analytically and rather tersely
 at <a href="http://d0j.blogspot.com">thus spake hareesh
 nagarajan</a>. my observations are always <a
 href="http://d0j.blogspot.com/2009/09/why-does-tennis-have-fewer-unique.html">original</a>. my
 <a
 href="http://friendfeed.com/search?q=goo.gl+OR+twitgoo+OR+twitpic+from:hareesh">photo
 blog</a> as seen from the camera of my phone. my <a
 href="http://www.google.com/profiles/hareesh.nagarajan">buzz+twitter
 feed</a>. i think i've bored you <a
 href="http://www.google.com/#q=hareesh+nagarajan">enough</a></p>
